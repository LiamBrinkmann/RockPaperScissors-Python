# RockPaperScissors-Python
Simple rock paper scissors done in python

This repository was made for the homework of CMPG 323

I was unsure of which solution to use that had impacted my career. I instead opted to showcase python, it was the first language that i began learning to code in. I only truly began learning in my first year of the university where we learnt python in our first cmpg module.

This project is a very simple one due to the time constraints. And it has been a while since i have used python. I planned on uploading my personal discord bot as a showcase as it was my first solo project with python but due to discord.py going down it no longer really matters.
